kjvnumerics.com
========================

KJVNumerics.com Project
This project is in it's initial startup phase. The intention is to turn kjvnumerics.com into a full fledge application
in which users can search out the numerical meaning in the King James Version of the Bible.

I am making the project public because I think something like this should be available to everyone.

I also would like people's ideas and help if anyone wishes to do so. The application will be built with PHP for the
backend, MySQL for the database, and will use Sencha ExtJS framework extensively for the front end.

Please be patient with me while I get the project setup.
